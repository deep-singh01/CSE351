# CSE351
UW CSE 351 - Prof. Justin Hsia (Fall '23)

Course Description: This course should develop students' sense of what really happens when software runs â€“ and that this question can be answered at several levels of abstraction, including the hardware architecture level, the assembly level, the C programming level, and the Java programming level. The core around which the course is built is C, assembly, and low-level data representation, but this is connected to higher levels (roughly how basic Java could be implemented), lower levels (the general structure of a processor), and the role of the operating system (but not how the operating system is implemented).
